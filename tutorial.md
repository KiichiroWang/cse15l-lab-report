# Week 1 Tutorial Lab: How to Log into ieng6

## 1. Setting Up Your CSE15L Account

To being setting up your account, head to the link below:

First, lookup your account through inputting your UCSD username and student ID, or alternatively your last name and student ID.
If your information is correct, you should then be able to find your username for the class that starts with *cs15lwi23*.

Clicking on your username should bring you to a page where you can then choose to change your password. The process of changing your process
is extremely specific so be careful and make sure to abide by every password requirement (length, symbols, numbers, etc).

## 2. Installing Visual Studio Code

Now it's time to install Visual Studio Code.

Head to the link and then follow all the appropriate download instructions for your specific computer. After installation,
open up VS Code and hopefully something similar to this will appear.
